## Setup Instructions

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=intro-python --display-name "Intro Python"
```

## Notes

- All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- If you want to use `torchviz` to visualize computational graphs, youâ€™ll need to install the Graphviz system binary (`dot`) separately.
